## Premise
The game will be an addictive 2D speed-based platform game and will focus on
fast moving action and racing. In single player mode the player will try to get
to the end of the map in the least amount of time. In multiplayer mode the
player can race against other players. The game will require fast reactions 
and button spamming to win races.

## Player Motivation
The player will be driven to achieve the fastest record time on a map and beat
his peers in multiplayer mode by mastering new techniques and reacting faster
to the changing map conditions. As the player progresses they will unlock new
maps but the basic movement techniques will remain the same. The player just
becomes better at incorporating them into their play style to move faster.
